3D Telemac setups.

Improvements:
- [x] Wiggles in free-surface
  - Adjust "FREE SURFACE GRADIENT COMPATIBILITY" (lower)
  - Adjust "IMPLICITATION FOR DEPTH" and "IMPLICITATION FOR VELOCITIES"
  - "SOLVER FOR PROPAGATION" and "SCHEME FOR ADVECTION OF VELOCITIES"?
  - Turb models?
  - Increasing time steps can filter out these oscillations.
